        <section id="introduction">
            <p>As specified in the requirement specification, the project aims to develop a practical system that
                utilizes Meshtastic, Arduino-based nodes, and drones to create a deployable mobile network in disaster-prone or
                network-deprived areas. The main components include LoRaWAN Arduino modules, the use of the Meshtastic project to create our
                mobile network, an application developed with Flutter that serves as the controller of the said mobile network,
                and drones to deploy the modules so that the network region can be created. Modules will be reprogrammed
                with the necessary code, C++, to correspond to the app. The Meshtastic communication project
                will be a main function in our Lora-Net application to help create the off-grid mobile network using an
                API. Drones will be equipped with an Arduino module, both being equipped with different sensors to identify
                their surroundings, and a designated feature to carry each module to its intended location.</p>

                <p><strong>Arduino Modules</strong></p>
                <P>The Arduino Modules subsystem manages the functionality of all the Arduino modules used to create
                    the LoRa mesh network. In terms of hardware, the drones and sensors used in the project will be
                    integrated through the Arduino modules. This subsystem will also be responsible for managing all the data being
                    passed through the network.</p>

                <p><strong>Meshtastic</strong></p>
                <p>The Meshtastic subsystem involves using Meshtasticâ€™s routing protocol to help create a network for
                    the region that will be marked by the Arduino modules. Meshtastic devices within range will form a
                    mesh network that allows messages to pass back and forth between the connected devices.
                    It primarily includes the Mesh routing algorithm, which uses Bluetooth to connect to both the Lora
                    32 modules and the Lora-Net application.</p>

            <section id="drone-description">
                <p><strong>Drone</strong><sup>*</sup></p>
                <p>The drone subsystem will consist of two main components, the module mount and the drone remote.
                    This subsystem will play an important role in transporting the Arduino modules after the user
                    receives the optimal network setup location from the LoRa-Net application.
                    The Arduino modules will be attached to the drones via the module mount,
                    and the instruction/direction for the drone will be received from the drone remote that the user
                    controls.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="sensors-description">
                <p><strong>Sensors</strong></p>
                <p>The Sensor subsystem is responsible for collecting critical data from both the Arduino modules and
                    drones. It comprises several individual subsystems, each dedicated to specific functions, including GPS
                    location data, battery level monitoring, and accelerometer data. These subsystems work collaboratively to
                    optimize the placement of the Arduino modules and drones within the desired network coverage area.

                <p><strong>Human Machine Interface</strong></p>
                <p>The Human Machine Interface should be able to allow the user to interact and manipulate the LoRa Net.
                    The subsystems under this section would help the user set preferences with the network, GPS, and
                    application, sending information and requests to the Arduino Modules to help carry out some of these commands.
                    We also hope to add drone functionality for the user, but this is a lesser goal.</p>

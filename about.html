      <p><strong>Problem Statement</strong></p>

      <p>In disaster-prone or remote areas where conventional communication infrastructure is often absent or
        disrupted, there is a pressing need for a practical solution to establish reliable communication networks.
        Natural disasters, such as hurricanes or earthquakes, can disrupt communication channels, leaving communities in
        isolation.
        To address this issue, we aim to create a mobile network solution using Meshtastic,
        Arduino-based nodes, and drones. The objective is to develop a system that deploys a mobile network
        capable of providing critical communication in such areas. This solution aims to mitigate the problem
        by ensuring timely and essential communication, ultimately enhancing emergency response efforts.</p>

      <p><strong>Methodology</strong></p>

      <p>Our approach encompasses two key components: hardware development and software implementation.
        In hardware development, we carefully select and configure essential components,
        including Arduino-based nodes with Meshtastic capabilities and specialized drones designed for network
        deployment.
        Rigorous testing in controlled environments ensures hardware performance, signal strength, and connectivity,
        guaranteeing reliability in the field.</p>

      <p>On the software side, we create an application to serve as the central controller of our mobile network.
        Users interact with this app to define areas of interest on a map, specifying desired network coverage
        parameters.
        An algorithm utilizes this input to determine optimal positioning of nodes and drones, maximizing coverage and
        signal strength.
        Integration of Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) data into the software dynamically optimizes node and
        drone positions
        for enhanced network performance.</p>

      <p>For mobile network deployment, users trigger network deployment through the application, generating an
        on-demand "mobile" network.
        Drones play a crucial role by strategically positioning nodes to ensure adequate network coverage.
        The software enables drones to adapt to changing conditions, continually optimizing network efficiency.</p>

      <p>The project concludes with comprehensive testing and evaluation. Simulating disaster scenarios and
        network-deprived areas
        assesses the mobile network’s real-world performance. Key performance metrics, including signal strength,
        network stability,
        and coverage area, guide our evaluation. Valuable feedback from first responders, emergency personnel,
        and field users drives further refinements.</p>
